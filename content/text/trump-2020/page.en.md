For sure, U.S.A. president Trump will be re-elected in 2020. This is a short why. One established and rarely questioned fact is the one where those who benefits mostly from Trump’s reign, and “corruption he surfaced”, are the rich dudes from Republican Party.

Majority of those who are at the helm of Democratic Party, are also rich. Keep that in mind.

Parallel to being rich, they could also be (put whatever you want here that makes them “democrats and not republicans”: race, sexual orientation, religion, political opinion...), but they are primarily full of money. That fact also makes them feel isolated and safe from all those MAGA hat owners as street rage looms.

Of course that they despise Trump as human, but they also love his offer of free money. Trump, not only he makes the republicans far richer and more powerful but, he also do the same to the democrats. Trump knows that, and democrats knows too.

Is that a contradiction? Nope.

At the surface, he is verbally attacked and declared con-man-scum. Deep in their harts, they hate Trump as he despise and ridicules something-something that perhaps those top democrats are also, but at the bowel level... they all love the money. That’s common shared interest.

How does it ends in this fortune-telling? His elected opponent in 2020 election will be somebody similar to Hillary. Politician, one that for sure looks like a safe bet but will lose badly. Perhaps that Bidden guy.

For some, the push for Bidden will be intentionally. Most will simply follow that feeling in the bowel. Once Trump wins, the stomach will be fine, the harts pleased as they are not guilty... so at the surface level, they can start bashing somebody somewhere for something.

Is that hypocrisy? Don’t know, for me that’s standard human behaviour. They are all in the pursue of personal gains, and the only way forward is to follow the money.

Snake oil seller & fortune-teller hope is the one where god does not help America this time around.
