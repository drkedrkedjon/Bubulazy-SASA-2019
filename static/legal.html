Some legal shit...

We do not use cookies or any other kind of tracking scripts or disturbing user privacy shit on this web site. The only place with some third-party cookies are the pages where YouTube video is embedded. Those are from Google. I use no tracking option for embed, but you should take that google promise with a big grain of salt.
